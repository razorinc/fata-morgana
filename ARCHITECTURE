Calls to cartridge hooks
========================

Tentative:

Calls to all cartridge hooks will take the following form:

$cartridge/$hook $APP_GUID $COMPONENT_GUID $APP_NAME

cartridge = Cartridge we're working with (php, apache, mysql, etc)
hook = Call to the hook we want (start, stop, deconfigure)
app_guid = The unique identifier for the app (UUID)
component_guid = The instance identifier for app (unique to each app in a
    cluster.  if an app has 2 nodes in the cluster, each app on that node
    would get a different component_guid - like instance_1 instance_2)
app_name = String name used for messaging (in express $NAME-$DOMAIN)
